#### A bit about me
I come from Pune, India. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. In my free time I like helping my friends or anyone for that matter with computers and development. I am learning Japanese along with my bachelors course. I love cooking, cycling and swimming sometimes. Hit me up if you have a project on mind and maybe we can take it to the moon ðŸš€
